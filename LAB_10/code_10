//Write a C program (name it "filecopy. c") that copies the contents of one file to a destination file. This program will read data from one file and copy them to another. The first input that the program will need is the names of the two files: input file ("input.txt") and output file ("output.txt"). Once the two file names have been obtained. the program must open the input file and create and open the output file.
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *src, *dest;
    char source[100], target[100];
    char ch;

    printf("Enter source file name: ");
    scanf("%s", source);
    printf("Enter destination file name: ");
    scanf("%s", target);

    src = fopen(source, "r");
    if (src == NULL) {
        printf("Cannot open source file.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    dest = fopen(target, "w");
    if (dest == NULL) {
        printf("Cannot create destination file.\n");
